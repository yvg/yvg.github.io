      <h1>Yves Van Goethem</h1>
      <h2>Software Engineering</h2>
      <p>Over the years I have figured out how and under which conditions I like to work, what drives me, and which criteria enhance my productivity and happiness.</p>

        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>Purpose is a personal driver like no other. If your core business is advertising, crypto, or other dubious endevours, there is little to no chance I will be interested to join you.</p>
        <p>If you work on solving real problems for real people, I am all ears.</p>
        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <p>An open and diverse environment is primordial to me. From experience, happy competent people collaborating with each other bring the best results.</p>
        <h2>Work-life balance</h2>
        <p>While I am ok with putting in a few extra hours on rare occasions, or getting paged at night when a critical system is failing. Regular over-time is not something I do, and must be addressed if recurring.</p>
        <p>I also value flexible working hours and remote work from my cosy, silent, home.</p>
        <h2>Transparency</h2>
        <p>I work more effectively when the company shares as much of the long-term intentions as possible. It prevents misunderstandings, leads to better technical decisions, and encourages a trusting work environment.</p>
        <h2>Role</h2>
        <p>I like to involve myself with business goals, technical architecture, team processes, recruitment, company culture, and mentoring. Therefore I am particularly open for leadership roles, be it purely technical, or hands-on management.</p>
