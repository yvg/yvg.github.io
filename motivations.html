      <h1>Yves Van Goethem</h1>
      <h2>Front-End Engineer</h2>
      <p>Over the years I have figured out how and under which conditions I like to work, what drives me, and which criteria enhance my productivity and happiness.</p>

        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>Purpose is a personal driver like no other. If your core business is advertising or fintech, there is little to no chance I will be interested to join you.</p>
        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <p>An open and diversified environment is primordial to me. From my experience, autonomous people and cross functional-teams working through consensus and helping each other bring the best results. Micro-management is not acceptable.</p>
        <h2>Work-life balance</h2>
        <p>While I am ok with putting in a few extra hours in rare occasions, or getting paged at night when a critical system is failing. Regular over-time is not something I do, and must be addressed if recurring.</p>
        <p>I also value flexible working hours and occassional remote work from my cosy, silent, home.</p>
        <h2>Transparency</h2>
        <p>I work more effectively when the company shares as much of the long-term intentions as possible. It prevents misunderstandings, leads to better technical decisions, and encourages a trusting work environment.</p>
        <h2>Technology</h2>
        <p>I am mostly knowledgeable about Front-End Engineering and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, in particular <strong>Mobile Web</strong>, <strong>Web Performance</strong>, <strong>Internationalisation</strong>, <strong>HTML & CSS</strong> and <strong>Accessibility</strong>. I enjoy writing vanilla code, as-well as using frameworks such as <strong>Backbone.JS</strong>, <strong>React-Native</strong>, <strong>Express</strong>, etc.</p>
        <h2>Role</h2>
        <p>Beyond building features and fixing bugs, I like to involve myself with technical architecture, recruitment, company culture, and mentoring. Therefor I am particularly looking for a role as senior software engineer, or as tech lead.</p>
