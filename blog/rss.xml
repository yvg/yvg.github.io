# Stop Human Approval in Pull Requests: A case for better collaboration

Human Approval in Pull Requests has become a common practice in software development. The approach is championed by big tech, open-source projects and tech influencers. Teams that use it often believe that this approach ensures quality, avoids issues, is collaborative, and helps to learn from each other. "It works well for me" you might say, echoing the sentiment shared by countless others and ingrained in our habits.

But what ifâ€¦ What if human approval in PRs is not only unnecessary, but also **detrimental** to the quality, speed, and collaboration of your teams?

Consider a scenario where a developer submits a PR, eagerly awaiting feedback. However, after a bit of back-and-forth, days pass without any approval, leaving the author and the reviewer frustrated, and the project delayed.

Sounds familiar?

One more example: A critical decision awaits approval, but the reviewer is absent. The team is stuck, unable to move forward.

I have seen these, and many other scenarios, play out countless times, and I believe that there are better alternatives.

In this article, I hope to give you a new perspective and inspire you to experiment with a more collaborative approach to software development.

## Delays

The evident consequence of human approval is delay. While numerous delays can be attributed to it, we can summarise it to one: **delayed value delivery to end-customers.** In turn, this results in delayed feedback to enhance our products.

Many of the same organisations pride themselves in embracing agility and following lean principles. However, if you are familiar with the [8 Wastes of Lean](https://theleanway.net/The-8-Wastes-of-Lean), waiting for approval is a waste of time, and a major (if not the biggest) reason for slow delivery. It's also a waterfall principle right in the middle of the process.

The immediate consequence of this is visible in metrics. For instance, lead times and delivery frequency visibly improve when human approval is not part of the process.

## Quality

Thoroughly reviewing a PR, fully understanding the acceptance criteria, verifying the architecture, the layers, reading all files (not just the diff), understanding how it all belongs together, thinking about each variable name, validating interfaces, reading the tests, running the code,â€¦ is a lot of work.

And let's be frank, most people don't engage in such a comprehensive review. Nobody has the capacity, energy, or time for this.
Instead, it's very common to skim through the PR, look for a few things that one would do differently, and comment on those.

A more effective way to ensure quality is for people to collaborate, to align beforehand, and to continuously teach each other. Through practices such as pair programming team members can agree on software principles, architectural concepts and design patterns; they should write them down and point to them in every discussion.

Bug detection, static analysis, pattern enforcement, test coverage, linting,â€¦ should be automated as much as possible.

## Interpersonal Friction

It's not uncommon to see heated discussions in PRs, with people getting upset, angry, and frustrated. In the worst cases, people have to be reminded to be respectful and professional by their managers, or worse.

Still, well-formulated and well-intentioned comments can be misinterpreted.

By removing human approval, we must shift how we interact with one another. A highly successful way to do so is to use **pair programming**, **mob programming**, or at least to practice **pair code-reviewing**. It's much easier to have a conversation about code, share ideas, and learn from each other synchronously with a common contextual understanding, than to try to convey the same context, information and sentiment asynchronously in comments.

## Ownership

When we introduce human approval, we implicitly convey that we don't trust each other. That others must check our work.

This tends to diminish accountability. Some people are less likely to feel responsible for the work they do, while others might feel responsible for everybody's work.

A healthier approach is to foster individual responsibility for one's work. To let authors decide when and when not to ask for help, and be fully accountable for the outcome â€” not by blaming them when things go wrong, but by helping them to learn from their mistakes.

This in turn leads to a culture of continuous learning, increased individual competency, and a more autonomous team.

It's a fantastic way to ensure continuous growth, eliminate the fear of merging, and become better at what we do, truly collaboratively.

## Context Switching

This is an obvious one which leads to many interruptions and fatigue.
Human approvals tend to increase context switching as everybody is asking each other to review pieces of work asynchronously and in parallel.
In the best case, people batch-review and dedicate time in their day to do so.

A more efficient way to work is to focus on a single task at a time, from definition to completion, and only then move to a new task. It is a well-known principle of lean methodologies and one of the most impactful ways to improve our workflow.

## Conclusion / `tl;dr`

Human approval in PRs delays delivery, does not ensure quality, creates friction, diminishes ownership, and leads to enormous context switching.

Automation and a culture of real-time collaboration, in which everyone assumes best intentions, can replace the need for human approval in its entirety.

The details are up to each team, it's hard to prescribe a one-size-fits-all solution. What I can guide you with are principles that usually lay the foundation for a successful transition to a more collaborative workflow:

- **Assume best intentions**
- **Autonomy through frequent alignment**
- **Automate everything**
- **Collaborate in real-time**
- **Focus on one task at a time**
- **Metrics over opinions**

I realise each of these principles could be a blog post on its own, and if time permits, I will explore them in the future.

For now, I hope I have sparked some curiosity and that you will experiment with these ideas with your team.
