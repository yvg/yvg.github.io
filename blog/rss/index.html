When I write, I want to focus on content, not on Markdown or HTML syntax.</p><p>For ToolTime, we have chosen to self-host Ghost, however, that did not feel like a good option for a personal blog, it&apos;s rather costly both in terms of money and time to set up and maintain. And for personal usage, I don&apos;t want to think about resources, I don&apos;t want to think about content delivery, availability, databases, etc.</p><p>So I forgot about Ghost and <a href="https://indieweb.social/@yvg/109737589526058311">asked people on Mastodon</a> what they think a blogging setup should look like. Let&apos;s be frank: I wasn&apos;t convinced by any of the answers.</p><p>Eventually, I came back to Ghost, I started wondering if I should simply spend $10 a month for them to care for everything&#x2026; I decided not to, instead, I read through their docs and found weird setups like running Ghost with <em>Gatsby</em> or using <em>11tly</em> as a front-end for a Ghost admin. But what I really wanted was the Ghost writing experience and theming, not a live-running Ghost instance feeding data through a GraphQL API to run Gatsby.</p><h1 id="hooray-npm-community">Hooray npm community</h1><p>That&apos;s when I discovered <code><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ghost-static-site-generator">ghost-static-site-generator</a></code> a tiny command-line tool built in node, seemingly meant to generate a static site from an existing Ghost setup.</p><p>For the folks that don&apos;t use the JS ecosystem much, you&apos;ll first have to install <code><a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/install">npm</a></code>.&#x200C;&#x200C;</p><p>Then you&apos;ll need to install:</p><ol><li><strong>ghost-cli:</strong> <code>npm install -g ghost-cli@latest</code></li><li>(Optional) <code>wget</code> if your OS doesn&apos;t come with it.</li><li><strong>ghost-static-site-generator:</strong> <code>npm install -g ghost-static-site-generator</code></li></ol><p>From here on, you can now install a local ghost instance, create an empty folder on your machine and run: <code><strong>ghost install local</strong></code>.</p><p>Open the instance in your browser, customise your theme and preferences to your liking, and once you are done. You only need to run: <code><strong>gssg --preview</strong></code>.</p><p>That&apos;s it. What you are seeing now is a statically-served Ghost blog. And a <code>static</code> folder holding the generated content on your disk.</p><p>Given I host this website on Github Pages, all I have to do now is copy the result to my tracked git directory, commit, and push.</p><p>This manual step is something many static-site generators require, which is an acceptable tiny burden to me.</p><hr><p>I hope this is somewhat useful to a couple of curious folks out there.<br>Have a good one!</p><h2 id="tldr">tl;dr:</h2><pre><code class="language-shell">ghost install local
